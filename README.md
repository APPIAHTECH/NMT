<!-- About the project -->

## üòé About

Sign language are communication system using gestures that are interpreted
visually. Many people in the worldwide deaf and hard of hearing communities
use sign languages as their primary means of communication. The deaf society
of the world needs to have access to all the information just like hearing people
do. For this aim, there should be a mode of direct communication between
hearing and deaf people.

In this thesis, we present a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model system to
translate gloss german sign language text to an equivalent german text
language, and vice-versa. In order to propose an effective system, we experimented with different
encoder-decoder topologies using several neural architectures (Transformers
and Long short-term memory (LSTM)). We then find a data-driven mapping
between glosses and the equivalent sentence language in other domains.
The different approaches are evaluated on a recently released german glosses
sign language translation dataset. In the experiments reported here, we
compare the different settings based on the BLEU-4 score to guide the model
and model tuning.

The outcomes of this research are expected to contribute to reducing the
communication barriers between both parties.
